# About

`cxxd` is a C/C++ language server which offers rich support for features that aid the process of source code navigation, editing,
automatic formatting, static analysis etc. One can utilize it, for example, to bring IDE-like features to an editor of your choice.

In essence, the main idea behind it is very much alike to what [`LSP`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) offers 
and its implementations like [`clangd`](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html).

# API

API tries to stay fairly trivial and straightforward without putting too much burden (impl. details) on the frontend side but there are couple of important bits and pieces that should be understood in order to efficiently use this API.

## Design
### Services
Aforementioned features are organized into [services](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/tree/remove_frontend_code/services).
Each [service](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/blob/remove_frontend_code/service.py):
* Is assigned its own unique ID
* Runs in its own context (process)
* Supports a set of common operations: `startup`, `shutdown`, `request`
* Provides a user-defined hook, so called [`plugin`](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/blob/remove_frontend_code/service_plugin.py), to be invoked on completion of any of the supported operations

### Server
Communication with any of the `service` is established/routed via proxy [`server`](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/blob/remove_frontend_code/server.py) which sits in between the client (frontend) and corresponding `service`. Server implements a very simple API:
* `start-all-services`
* `start-service`
* `shutdown-all-services`
* `shutdown-service`
* `send-service-request`

[Public API](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/blob/remove_frontend_code/api.py), which is exposed to clients, is implemented on top of `server` API.

### Async
API, due to the nature of features being implemented, is designed to work in an **asynchronous** fashion. That means that retrieving the result from corresponding operation cannot be done via regular (synchronous) return-value mechanism but instead one must register a hook (callback) object which will then be invoked once the result is ready (after operation has completed). These callbacks we call `plugin`s.

### Plugin
Plugin is a mechanism to subscribe for a result of an asynchronous operation. This is a customization go-to point for client code to decide what to do with the result (e.g. process it further and communicate it back to the frontend using the appropriate inter-process mechanism).

### Diagram

TODO create an UML diagram for better overall picture

### Example usage

#### `cxxd` integration tests

[Integration test suite](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/blob/remove_frontend_code/tests/integration/test_all.py) is actually a representative example of a frontend which has a main purpose in validating the data computed by the services (e.g. if `go-to-definition` returns a valid/expected source code location). Some other frontends will rather like to do something more with the data, e.g. visualize it or populate the UI elements with it.

So, integration tests have all of the important bits which depict the usage of an API:

* We have to [start the server](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/blob/remove_frontend_code/tests/integration/test_all.py#L70-L80) before anything else.

* A mechanism which provides customization point for application-specific purposes is [factory function](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/blob/remove_frontend_code/tests/integration/test_all.py#L17-L26). Factory function will be invoked during the server startup phase. Its purpose is to provide a means to instantiate an application-specific server with main (customization) part being the [registration of application-specific plugins](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/blob/remove_frontend_code/tests/integration/test_all.py#L22-L25).

* Application-specific plugins in integration tests will only [make a copy](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/blob/remove_frontend_code/tests/integration/cxxd_plugins.py#L12) of received data to be able to [validate its contents](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/blob/remove_frontend_code/tests/integration/test_all.py#L114) from the test execution context.

* To communicate the received data to different execution contexts (processes), one shall use some form of inter-process communication mechanisms. This integration test suite implements the inter-process communication by utilizing the [shared-memory](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/blob/remove_frontend_code/tests/integration/cxxd_callbacks.py#L10) to store the data and [named-semaphores](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/blob/remove_frontend_code/tests/integration/cxxd_callbacks.py#L179) to synchronize between R/W accesses. Some other application will use other means to achieve the same (i.e. to communicate the data back to `vim` instance one could make use one of the [RPC mechanisms](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/remote.html) that `vim` provides).

* [Example](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd/blob/remove_frontend_code/tests/integration/test_all.py#L112-114) of triggering the service is running the source code indexer on the given directory, waiting until it is completed and querying if it has run successfuly.

* Many other examples depicting the usage of an API

# FAQ

## How do I make use of this in <insert_environment_of_your_choice>?

Look for and install a frontend suitable for your environment. I.e. [cxxd-vim](https://github.com/JBakamovic/cxxd-vim) if you want to try it out from Vim. This is only a backend server.
Other supported frontends are listed in the table from above and hopefully more will come with the help of community.

## How do I develop a new frontend on top of it?

Understand the [API](#api). Look how [cxxd integration tests](#cxxd-integration-tests) have been implemented on top if it. Look into other available frontend implementations, such as the one for [Vim](#frontend-implementation-for-vim).

## Why?

One may question the reasoning behind the existence of this project (given that we have other alternatives such as aforementioned `clangd`),
but the [whole idea and implementation](https://github.com/JBakamovic/yavide/commit/1100b027ba80637c2382913cb14f1a8ea34f3930#diff-a74ad8dfacd4f985eb3977517615ce25) 
started to grow couple of months before [LSP has been officially announced](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/06/27/common-language-protocol) and, this being my own pet project, I decided not to stop with the development but to try to drive it more forward.

Idea may not have been obvious or recognized by many people as it has been actively developed under my other project, [`Yavide`](https://github.com/JBakamovic/yavide), which is a heavily modded Vim so naturally not really attracted by many. In order to enable usage from different editors (or any other type of frontends), I have decied to finally put some effort into packaging the server functionality into this standalone repository.
